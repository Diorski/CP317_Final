Classes are useless / redundant because JSON files are just better for storing information
Downside being the complexity of the program is now doo doo 
Inheritence is basically non existant 

Need to fix the error handling for AccountCreateFrame (it literally has none LOL)
Need to add functionality to UserFrame to allow for transactions between accounts. 
- Use the AdminFrame method of choosing accounts and obtaining the records the code is all there
Consider changing the UserFrame to maybe have some functionality from feature of other classes? Deposit / Withdrawal Fees? 
Admin Panel can be changed a bit too if there's time. Instead of directly opening User Frame to edit the data maybe a custom
- AdminEditFrame can be created to mimic the UserFrame but with more permissions? 

Regarding use cases and actors perhaps add a new frame for Bank Teller Actor? 
Could maybe just finesse the wording there instead but would be cool
to have an AdminPanel and a BankTellerPanel
